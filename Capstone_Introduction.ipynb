There is no surprise the real estate market there is one of the priciest. It's where a penthouse at the new Peter Marino-designed flat The Getty, steps from the High Line, is sold for \\\\$50 million \nA quick search can show us the real estate price can vary by a large margin from neighbourhoods to neighbourhoods.  2-bedrooms flat in Central Park West, Upper West Side can cost \\\\$4.90 million on average. While in Inwood, Upper Manhattan, just 30 minutes away, it's only \\\\$490 thousand.  \n  \nHow can aspects of a neighbourhood affect the price of real estates to such extent? One hypothesis is that the surrounding venues can be a deciding factor.   \nCan the venues surrounding accommodation affect its price? And what kind of venues can affect the most? And by what weight?

Can surrounding venues affect the price of real estates?  \n2. What kind of surrounding places, and to what extent, affect the cost?  \n3. Can we use the surrounding venue to estimate the value of accommodation over the average price of one area? And to what degree of confidence? \n  \nThe result can be useful for home buyers, which can roughly estimate the value of a target house over the average.  ",
